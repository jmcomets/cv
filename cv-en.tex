\section{Experience}

\cventry{Nov. 2015\\ (current)}{Software engineer}{Murex}{Paris}{France}{Member of the Market Data Calculation Chain team, responsible for the load \& update of market data from the database and real-time services. As this step is key for the company's product, the focus was on using efficient data structures and optimal algorithms. The role consists in solving various problems when scheduling with a dependency graph (cycles, dynamic edges), as well as writing generic frameworks for asset class teams (C++ template meta-programming).}

\cventry{Apr. -- Sep. 2015}{Software development intern}{Murex}{Paris}{France}{Developed a visualization tool to "replay" the load of market data, using structured logs. Logging was done with Log4j/cxx to Logstash, output to an ElasticSearch cluster. The tool was built in Java but the structured logging was in C++.}

\cventry{May -- Aug. 2014}{Devops intern}{Fidbacks}{Paris}{France}{Main developer at a start-up aggregating and automatically validating client reviews for e-commerce sites. Developed the company's back-end which included: multiple web-scrapers, MVC website development (Ruby on Rails), a/b testing, background job queue processing. Also developed the company's custom CRM for internal use, and managed the application deployment on the cloud (Heroku, AWS S3/EC2).}

\cventry{Jun. -- Sep. 2013}{Lab intern}{LIRIS -- CNRS}{Villeurbanne}{France}{Implemented a thickness diagram based on the exact arrangement of 3D balls (CGAL, C++ template programming). Also built a front-end interface based on Qt/QGLViewer/GLUT.}

%\cventry{Sep. 2012\\ -- Jan. 2014}{JeuxVidéo@INSA association}{}{Villeurbanne}{France}{I was a member of the board of JeuxVidéo@INSA, a school association aiming to promote video game creation (design, development, storyline, etc...). We organized meetings with video game professionals, conferences and hackathons.}

\section{Projects}

\cventry{Feb. -- Apr. 2014}{twitto-feels}{}{}{}{School project. Sentiment analysis on a given timeline (Python, NLTK/TextBlob), using Twitter's streaming API.}

\cventry{Dec. -- Feb. 2014}{KHome}{}{}{}{"Smart Home" managed system (sensors, actuators) with a DSL to script modules, built alongside an app store and a process communication system resembling JSON-RPC (back-end in Python, web interface with AngularJS).}

\cventry{Sep. 2013}{TESS}{}{}{}{Built a search-engine based on model indexing (Scikit-learn, ElasticSearch, Flask). 1st place at a \href{http://www.fhacktory.com}{FHacktory} hackathon.}

%\cventry{Jul. -- Sep. 2013}{IntoSpectrum}{}{}{}{Developing an server-sided audio-player with a web front-end using NodeJS.}
